# Mosaic-creation-using-8-point-Algorithm
I tried to create panaroma using 5 images using 7 point algorithm. Basic steps towards this is to compute homography matrices for pair of frames, by using homography matrix we can compute rotation and translation between 2 successive frames. Later use these rotation and translation parameters to get warped panaromic image.
