function[eMatrix] = eightPoint(matchedPoints1, matchedPoints2, K1, K2)
% Function Introdution:
% Given a set of correspondences between two images and the intrisic matrix
% of the calibrated camera for both views, compute the essential matrix
% associated with the epipolar geometry using eight points
%
% Inputs:
% matchedPoints1 - the coordinates of matched features in the first image,
%   expressed in inhomogeneous coordinate. The size is of Nx2, where N is the
%   number of matched points
% matchedPoints2 - same as above
% K1 - the intrisic matrix of the calibrated camera from the first view
% K2 - the intrisic matrix of the calibrated camera from the second view
%
% Outputs:
% eMatrix - the computed essential matrix
